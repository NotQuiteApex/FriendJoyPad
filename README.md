# FriendJoyPad
A nice game controller I'm experimenting with.

# Hardware
Made with 3D printed parts and an ESP32, specifically a NodeMCU-32S. Standard breadboard tactile buttons for face buttons and dpad and two rear paddles, analog sticks, mouse rotary encoders for the shoulder buttons, and dual analog/digital combo triggers. Still a work in progress.

# Firmware
Firmware for the controller is in the `MCU/` folder, made with PlatformIO. Based on https://github.com/lemmingDev/ESP32-BLE-Gamepad/
